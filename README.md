# ⚡ Pokemon Battle Simulator

A learning project for practicing **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python.
Battle Pokemon, level them up, evolve them, and earn eggs — all powered by the
free [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

> **Note:** This is a learning scaffold. The structure, classes, comments, and
> method signatures are all in place, but the method bodies are left as `TODO`s
> for you to implement. Each one has a docstring explaining exactly what to do.

## ✨ Features (to build)

- 🔍 Search the Pokedex and add Pokemon to your party
- ⚔️ Turn-based battle simulator with type effectiveness
- 📈 Level up and evolve your Pokemon by winning
- 🥚 Win a random base-form egg after each victory, then hatch it
- 💾 Persistent storage with SQLite — your team is saved between sessions
- 👤 Trainer accounts with party + PC box management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the backend

```bash
python app.py
```

The API starts at **http://localhost:5000** and creates `pokemon.db` on first run.

### 3. Open the frontend

Either open `frontend/index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it:

```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit **http://localhost:8000**.

### 4. (Optional) Use local sprites

Sprites load from PokeAPI by default. To bundle them locally instead:

```bash
python scripts/download_sprites.py --enable
```

See [Sprites](#️-sprites) below for details.

## 🖼️ Sprites

The app uses remote PokeAPI sprite URLs out of the box, so there's nothing to
download to get started. When you want to bundle your **own local sprite
archive**, one command downloads them and switches the app over:

```bash
python scripts/download_sprites.py --enable
```

Downloaded sprites are **gitignored** — they stay on your machine and aren't
committed (keeps the repo small; avoids redistributing Nintendo's art). Anyone
who clones the project just runs that command once.

Under the hood every sprite resolves through `SpriteResolver`
([`frontend/js/sprites.js`](frontend/js/sprites.js)), so a single
`USE_LOCAL_SPRITES` flag flips the whole UI between remote and local (with
automatic fallback to remote if a local file is missing). The `--enable` flag
just sets that flag for you. Full details in
[`frontend/assets/sprites/README.md`](frontend/assets/sprites/README.md).

## 🎓 OOP Concepts Covered

| Concept           | Where to find it                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Class**         | `models/pokemon.py`, every model          |
| **Encapsulation** | Private attrs + `@property` in `pokemon.py`|
| **Inheritance**   | `database/schemas.py` (all extend `Base`) |
| **Composition**   | `egg.py` contains data to build a Pokemon  |
| **Aggregation**   | `trainer.py` holds collections of Pokemon |
| **State Machine** | `battle.py` (pending → in_progress → finished) |
| **Facade**        | `services/battle_engine.py`               |
| **SRP / DRY**     | service layer separation                  |

## 🛠️ Suggested Implementation Order

1. `models/pokemon.py` — stat formulas, `take_damage`, `heal`, `gain_xp`
2. `models/move.py` — PP management (quick warm-up)
3. `models/egg.py` — the `hatch()` method
4. `models/trainer.py` — party management
5. `models/battle.py` — battle loop + damage calculation
6. `services/pokeapi_service.py` — `get_pokemon_data()` first
7. `services/battle_engine.py` — wire it all together
8. `routes/*` — Flask endpoints
9. `frontend/js/*` — implement the `TODO` stubs
